A brief history about us
Our company, "Swift-bruss", was founded in 2012 by a group of socially-minded entrepreneurs who saw the need for accessible financial services for low-income individuals and small businesses. They believed that by providing small loans and other financial services to these underbanked populations, they could help to promote economic growth and reduce poverty in their community.
In the early days, Swift-bruss focused on providing small loans to micro-entrepreneurs in their local area. They quickly realized that there was a high demand for their services and decided to expand their operations by opening new branches in other cities.
As the company grew, they started to offer a wider range of financial services, such as savings accounts, insurance, and money transfers. They also began to develop innovative new products, such as mobile banking services, to make it easier for their customers to access their services.
In 2013, Swift-bruss received an investment from a major venture capital firm, which allowed them to scale up their operations and expand into new markets. By 2015, Swift-bruss had become one of the largest microfinance companies in the country, serving thousands of customers and providing millions of dollars in loans and other financial services.
Throughout its history, Swift-bruss has always been guided by its mission to empower the underbanked and promote economic growth.
